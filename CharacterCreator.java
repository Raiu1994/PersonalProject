  For Nations: Player Name, Origin, Origin Sub-type, Military, Economy, Diplomacy, Modified Military, Modified Economy, Modified Diplomacy, Government Type, Nation Name. Create 2 arrays for Powers and Historical Importances that change based on how many Powers/HI are given by their chosen info.
  For Pathfinder: Player Name, Character Name, Level. Look to PFSRD for full list.
