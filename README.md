# PersonalProject
This is the personal project of Griffin Scott, which shall be known as "Griffin Scott's Ultimate Character Creator."

[The program will be created in JavaScript.]

This project will be due on November 20th, and it will be a test to see how quickly I can learn a language and how well I can code in it.

Wish me luck! I get the feeling I'll need it.

11/13: Trying to struggle through creating a program in JavaScript didn't work, so I am switching from JavaScript to Java, which is a programming language that I am familiar with. The fact that I waited this long to switch just makes my job that much harder.

Things to be done:
*Create Game System Selector (Need to use console.log inorder to determine whatGame)
*Create Public Class Character Creator (Use Case for each section, one Case for each game system. Need a text parser for some inputs).
*Create Export Method (exports character sheets as a txt file).
*Create Save System (Should hold character sheets from instance to instance. Maybe use the Export file for this.)
