# PersonalProject
This is the personal project of Griffin Scott, which shall be known as "Griffin Scott's Ultimate Character Creator."

[The program will be created in JavaScript.]

This project will be due on November 20th, and it will be a test to see how quickly I can learn a language and how well I can code in it.

Wish me luck! I get the feeling I'll need it.

11/13: Trying to struggle through creating a program in JavaScript didn't work, so I am switching from JavaScript to Java, which is a programming language that I am familiar with. The fact that I waited this long to switch just makes my job that much harder.

11/20: Finish product will be delayed, but will be finished by the end of Thanksgiving break. I have switched from Atom to Eclipse for the project so that I will be able to run the code as I edit it. 

12/3: Griffin Scott's Ultimate Character Creator is now in version 0.5 and is in a presentable state. Yes!
